          <!-- <p>Recent end-to-end speech language models (SLMs) have expanded upon the capabilities of large language
            models (LLMs) by incorporating pre-trained speech models. However, these SLMs often undergo
            extensive speech instruction-tuning to bridge the gap between speech and text modalities. This
            requires significant annotation efforts and risks catastrophic forgetting of the original language
            capabilities. In this work, we present a simple yet effective automatic process for creating
            speech-text pair data that carefully injects speech paralinguistic understanding abilities into SLMs
            while preserving the inherent language capabilities of the text-based LLM. Our model demonstrates
            general capabilities for speech-related tasks without the need for speech instruction tuning data,
            achieving impressive performance on Dynamic-SUPERB and AIR-Bench-Chat benchmarks. Furthermore, our
            model exhibits the ability to follow complex instructions derived from LLMs, such as specific output
            formatting and chain-of-thought reasoning. Our approach not only enhances the versatility and
            effectiveness of SLMs but also reduces reliance on extensive annotated datasets, paving the way for
            more efficient and capable speech understanding systems.

          a structured "seed transcript." This seed transcript is then combined with the prompt "What can you hear from

          target for the end-to-end speech language model.</p>
        <p>There are 12 attributes, including gender, age, accent, emotion, pitch, volume, speaking speed, SNR level,
          C50 value, duration, intent, and spoken text.</p>

        <p>During the model training phase, we utilize a pre-trained Whisper model to extract speech features and
          generate text transcriptions from the audio input. These speech features and the text
          embeddings (from the transcription and chat template) are concatenated before being fed into Llama3. We
          maintain a
          consistent template structure to prevent any mismatch. Finally, the model is
          trained to generate speech descriptions, effectively learning to interpret and articulate the
          nuances of spoken content based on both acoustic features and textual information.
